# Project Manager
By Christheoreo
## About this project
My girlfriend is forever moaning about how I have too many projects on the go.

She never fails to roll her eyes when I say "I've got this great new idea" 

SO, she actually told me to pursue this idea! The Project Manager.

## What can this project do
This project is designed to track your project ideas, allowing you to specify what components you will use, the languages, frameworks, databases and more!

You will also be able to tag your projects with types, priorities, sizes etc.

This project will be running from [My website](https://project-manager.chrisfinlow.co.uk) OR there will be an instruction file on how to set this up to run on your own platforms.

## Can I contribute?
Yes! I am keen to have this project used by many people who have the same struggles as myself.

## What's going on in here?
So this project uses `go` for the API which uses postgres as the database.
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is the Front end framework I have chosen for the UI.

## About me
I am a full time Lead Developer for 17 Oranges. I mainly work with NodeJS and PHP - however my GoLang skills are slowly getting better
